Write an Assembly Language program to search a given byte in the list. If the element is found then store the index/location of that element in the memory. If the element is not found then store FFFFH in the memory.

INPUT Test Case 1: (8000H): 06H, Store the count of total numbers
(8001H): 55H, The number to be searched
(8002H to 8007H): 11H, 22H, 33H, 44H, 55H, 66H

OUTPUT: (8010H): 80 (8011H): 06

INPUT Test Case 2: (8000H): 06H, Store the count of total numbers
(8001H): 77H, The number to be searched
(8002H to 8007H): 11H, 22H, 33H, 44H, 55H, 66H

OUTPUT: (8010H): FF (8011H): FF

Approach : 
• simply iterate through all numbers by loop
• compare numbers with given/input number using CMP instruction & every time increment index(counter)
• if found then store index , otherwise store FFh

Code :
LXI H,8000H
MOV A,M
MOV E,A ; iterator/loop counter
LDA 8001H ; The number to be searched
LXI H,8002H
LXI B,8010H ; output

LOOP:CMP M
	   JZ STORE
     DCR E
     JZ NOTFOUND
     INR L
     JMP LOOP     
     
STORE:MOV A,H
	    STAX B
      INR C
      MOV A,L
      STAX B
      HLT
NOTFOUND:MVI A,FFH
		     STAX B
         INR C
         STAX B
         HLT
