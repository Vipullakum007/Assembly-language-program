Write an Assembly language program to find the sum of a series of even numbers. Store the count at memory location 2000h , next 5 locations are the numbers. Store the result at the memory location 20  10H.
Constraints : sum not exceeds 8 bits
Approach : 

Step 1 :
loop iterate through all numbers

Step 2 :

Case 1 : if rotate right (RRC instruction) set carry bit then number is ODD
Case 2 : other wise EVEN 

Step 3:

if case 2 happen then we need to restore our number so use RAL (for left shift)
other wise direct jmp to LOOP

Code : 

LXI H,2000H
MOV C,M; no of inputs
LXI H,2001H ; input start from here
LXI D,0 ;output

LOOP:MOV A,M
	   DCR C
	   INX H
     RRC ; chack odd or even
     JZ END
     JC LOOP ; odd then direct jump
     RAL ; restore number
     ADD D
     MOV D,A
     JMP LOOP

END:STA 2010H
	  HLT
